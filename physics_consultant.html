  <h1>PHYSICS CONSULTANT WANTED</h1>

  <p>I'm an undergrad looking for a physics consultant for weekly one-on-one meetings.</p>

  <p>A bit about myself:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I am learning physics out of curiosity.</li>
    <li>I am a CS / Phil major by trade.</li>
    <li>Unfortunately, I don't have time to fit a physics degree into my course load.</li>
    <li>Have taken linear algebra, diffeqs, E&amp;M.</li>
    <li>Some survey knowledge in quantum.</li>
    <li>Looking for mathematically rigorous foundations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Ideally, you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Love physics.</li>
    <li>Are interested in one or more of the following: statistical physics/thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, quantum computing, fundamentals of physics, relativity, information theory, particle physics, dynamical systems (any subset is fine!).</li>
    <li>Have mathematical maturity / a math background.</li>
    <li>Like pondering interesting questions and are willing to think about them deeply.</li>
    <li>Have deep intuitions about specific topics (you don't need to know everything!).</li>
    <li>Are willing to explain "the intuition" behind ideas as well as the mathematical underpinnings.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Preferred, but certainly not required:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Physics theory background.</li>
    <li>Interested in philosophy of physics.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some possible topics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Noether's theorem, symmetries in physics.</li>
    <li>Introduction to particle physics/string theory.</li>
    <li>Bell's inequality and results in quantum mechanics.</li>
    <li>Basics of thermodynamics/entropy.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some things we might do:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Learn what a Lagrangian is.</li>
    <li>Derive some basic results in your field of interest.</li>
    <li>Learn a lot of math (including the basics).</li>
    <li>Read papers/discuss books.</li>
    <li>Talk about your research (and the math I'd need to understand it deeply).</li>
    <li>Think about thought experiments.</li>
    <li>Solve exercises together.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If this sounds overwhelming, don't worry! I don't expect you to know everything â€” as long as you have a very solid foundation in one or more topics, that's enough for me.</p>

  <p>If any of this sounds like fun, please text me at 503-709-9149, and we can schedule an initial meeting.</p>
