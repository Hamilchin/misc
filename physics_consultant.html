  <h3>Hello! I'm Alexander, and I'm an undergrad looking for a physics guide/tutor for weekly one-on-one meetings. </h3>

  <p>A bit about myself:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I am a CS / Philosophy major by trade</li>
    <li>I am deeply fascinated by physics, and am learning it out of curiosity</li>
    <li>Unfortunately, I don't have time to fit a physics degree into my course load</li>
    <li>Have taken linear algebra, diffeqs, E&amp;M, and have some survey knowledge in quantum computing</li>
    <li>Looking to develop my physics knowledge with rigorous mathematical underpinnings</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Ideally, you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Love physics.</li>
    <li>Are interested in one or more of the following: statistical physics/thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, quantum computing, fundamentals of physics, relativity, information theory, particle physics, dynamical systems (any subset is fine!).</li>
    <li>Have mathematical maturity / a math background.</li>
    <li>Like pondering interesting questions and are willing to think about them deeply.</li>
    <li>Have deep intuitions about specific topics (you don't need to know everything!).</li>
    <li>Are willing to explain "the intuition" behind ideas as well as the mathematical underpinnings.</li>
    <li>Like reading books (particularly about physics, but other books are cool too!)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some possible topics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Noether's theorem, symmetries in physics.</li>
    <li>Introduction to particle physics/string theory.</li>
    <li>Bell's inequality and results in quantum mechanics.</li>
    <li>Basics of thermodynamics/entropy.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some things we might do:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Learn what a Lagrangian is.</li>
    <li>Derive some basic results in your field of interest.</li>
    <li>Learn a lot of math (including the basics).</li>
    <li>Read papers/discuss books.</li>
    <li>Talk about your research (and the math I'd need to understand it deeply).</li>
    <li>Think about thought experiments.</li>
    <li>Solve exercises together.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If this sounds overwhelming, don't worry! I don't expect you to know everything — as long as you have a very solid foundation in one or more topics, that's enough for me. </p>

  <p>  
  I don't have a particular textbook I want to follow, and I'm not trying to complete homework or cram for a test. Instead, I have a rolling list of interests and things I'd like to understand. Hopefully, that means our discussions will be fruitful and interesting for both me and you - hopeully you learn something too. We can incorporate resources/outside reading as needed. 
  </p>

  <b>I am willing to pay 45$ an hour, and possibly more, based on your level of expertise. </b>

  <p>If any of this sounds like fun, text me at: 503-709-9149 with your fields of interest and we can schedule an initial meeting.</p>
